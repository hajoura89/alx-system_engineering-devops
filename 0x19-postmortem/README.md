# Web Stack Outage Postmortem
# Issue Summary:
## Duration:
Start Time: January 15, 2023, 10:30 AM (UTC)
End Time: January 15, 2023, 1:45 PM (UTC)
## Impact:
The outage affected our primary web application service, causing a complete unavailability for approximately 25% of our users. Users experienced slow response times and intermittent errors during the outage.
## Root Cause:
The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to uneven distribution of traffic across server nodes.
## Timeline:
10:30 AM: Issue detected through an increased number of HTTP 500 errors reported in the monitoring system.
10:35 AM: Initial investigation focused on application servers, checking for errors in logs and resource utilization.
11:00 AM: No issues found on the application servers. Assumed the problem might be with the database servers and started investigating database queries.
11:30 AM: Database queries were optimized, but the issue persisted. Noticed that the load balancer logs showed uneven traffic distribution.
12:00 PM: Load balancer misconfiguration identified as the root cause. The misconfiguration led to some nodes being overwhelmed while others were underutilized.
12:30 PM: Incident escalated to the infrastructure team for load balancer adjustments. Load balancer settings were corrected to evenly distribute traffic.
1:45 PM: Normal service was restored, and all users regained access to the web application.
## Root Cause and Resolution:

## Root Cause:
The load balancer misconfiguration caused an uneven distribution of traffic, leading to overloading of some nodes and service degradation.
## Resolution:
The load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic across all server nodes. This not only resolved the immediate issue but also prevented future occurrences.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
## To Improve/Fix:
Enhance Monitoring: Implement more robust monitoring for load balancer performance, including alerts for uneven traffic distribution.
Automated Checks: Introduce automated checks to verify load balancer configurations against predefined standards, ensuring early detection of misconfigurations.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Review Load Balancer Configurations: Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations to identify any other potential misconfigurations.
Documentation Update: Enhance documentation regarding load balancer setup and configuration to prevent similar missteps in the future.
Training Session: Organize a training session for the operations team on load balancer management and troubleshooting.
## Conclusion:
The outage was a result of a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to uneven traffic distribution. Swift detection, focused investigation, and collaboration across teams allowed for a timely resolution. Moving forward, implementing enhanced monitoring and automated checks, along with continuous training, will fortify our infrastructure against similar incidents.
